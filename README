Binutils-Objdump version 0.01
=============================

objdump displays  information  about  one or more object files. The options 
control what particular information to display.  This information is mostly 
useful to programmers who are working on the compilation tools, as  opposed  to
programmers who just want their program to compile and work.

This module provides wrappers for the objdump output information parts, specified by 
special labels. To each part correspond a special wrapper, which can be extended by your own.

The script odasm is an example of disassembler based on Binutils::Objdump module.
